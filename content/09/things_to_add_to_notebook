1) mention that the point of GLMs is to create unique distributions for each unique set of covariates (because we have multiple responses at each unique set of covariates) by fitting the mean of a selected distribution to each unique set of covariates.

2) clarify that we want to use a linear function (mean function - inverse of link function) to estimate the mean of the selected distribution at each unique set of covariates.

3) start off by saying we want to use Poisson regression, rather than stating this after stating the link function

4) go more in detail on AIC: explain it as a way to estimate the relative amount of information lost between models

5) look up **model deviance**
	- play with different ways to compute the deviance (e.g. the model curve - a smoothed hist curve)

6) Why do we use the factor of 2 in AIC and deviance? -> related to chi-square value: 2 * negative log-likelihood = chi-square value

7) look up MLRTs and relation to chi-square distribution
	- why is the test statistics for MLRT equivalent to difference between deviances of nested models?
	- why is the degrees of freedom of the chi square statistics that comes from MLRT equal to k2 - k1?

8) How is the standard error for a parameter estimate calculated?
	- Look up Fisher information

9) Look up Wald test

10) Look up time-rescaling theorem

11) Look up ECDF class/function

12) Compute all model calculations without using built-in GLM class model attributes/methods

13) Look up difference between raw, deviance, and Pearson residuals. Add raw and deviance residuals to notebook.

14) add kstest to ks plots
