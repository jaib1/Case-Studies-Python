0)* don't reuse variable names - make them unique for different models

1)* add kstest to ks plots

2) look up AIC
	- go more in detail on AIC: explain it as a way to estimate the relative amount of information lost between models

3) look up **model deviance**
	- play with different ways to compute the deviance (e.g. the model curve minus a smoothed hist curve)

4) state why we use the factor of 2 in AIC and deviance? -> related to chi-square value: 2 * negative log-likelihood = chi-square value

5) look up MLRTs and relation to chi-square distribution
	- why is the test statistics for MLRT equivalent to difference between deviances of nested models?
	- why is the degrees of freedom of the chi square statistics that comes from MLRT equal to k2 - k1?

6) How is the standard error for a parameter estimate calculated?
	- look up Fisher information

7) look up Wald test

8) look up time-rescaling theorem

9) look up ECDF class/function

10) look up difference between raw, deviance, and Pearson residuals. Add raw and deviance residuals to notebook.

11) Compute all model calculations without using built-in GLM class model attributes/methods
