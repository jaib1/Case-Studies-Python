- add kstest to ks plots

- look up AIC
	- go more in detail on AIC: explain it as a way to estimate the relative amount of information lost between models

- look up model deviance
	- play with different ways to compute the deviance (e.g. the model curve minus a smoothed hist curve)

- state why we use the factor of 2 in AIC and deviance? -> related to chi-square value: 2 * negative log-likelihood = chi-square value

- look up MLRTs and relation to chi-square distribution
	- why is the test statistics for MLRT equivalent to difference between deviances of nested models?
	- why is the degrees of freedom of the chi square statistics that comes from MLRT equal to k2 - k1?

- how is the standard error for a parameter estimate calculated?
	- look up Fisher information

- look up Wald test

- look up time-rescaling theorem

- look up ECDF class/function

- look up difference between raw, deviance, and Pearson residuals. Add raw and deviance residuals to notebook.

- add a cross-validation method to evaluate models

- look up statsmodels GLM class api and examples

- Compute all model calculations without using built-in GLM class model attributes/methods
