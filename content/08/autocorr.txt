This can be a difficult question when  𝑁  is small (less than 30), but for larger  𝑁  we can approximate a confidence interval about the correlation coefficient using a normal approximation with standard deviation  1/𝑁⎯⎯⎯⎯√ . In this case, any correlation value exceeding  ±2/𝑁⎯⎯⎯⎯√  is unlikely to be generated by chance and likely reflects real dependence structure. For the increment process considered here,  𝑁=599 , and the significance bound is  ±0.08 . We conclude that none of the lags has significant autocorrelation.

1) Define `autocorr`

2) Use it and test it

3) How can we know if the returned autocorrelations are statistically significant? Approximate a CI.

4) Edit `autocorr` to incorporate CI. Calculate p-value using t-test.

5) Use it and test it.

6) Create tests which we can run with pytest (invalid input arg exception)

np.where((a >= 6) & (a <=10))
